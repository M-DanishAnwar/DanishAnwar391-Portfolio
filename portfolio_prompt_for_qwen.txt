Project: "Danish Anwar — 3D Tech + Fairy-Tale Portfolio"

Repo target: (commit to the repository connected to this Qwen session). Create a new branch named: `feat/3d-portfolio-v1`.

Primary goal:
Create a production-ready, visually stunning, responsive **3D portfolio website** that showcases Danish Anwar's identity as a visionary tech creator. The site must be immersive, fast, accessible, and fully structured for further development. Use the repo for all code, assets, docs, CI and deployment configs.

Design & UX brief (high-level):
- Visual style: dark theme base with colorful, realistic 3D elements & glass/snow reflections; modern UI with clean typography, subtle rounded corners, and soft shadows. Blues + whites + subtle accent colors as the palette.
- Experience: The site must feel like stepping into a fairy-tale tech world — continuous subtle animated effects (shiny sprinkles, electric pulses, flowing particle tails) that are interactive and performant.
- Navigation: Single-page feel with sections (landing/hero, about, projects, 3D "explorations" gallery, resume/skills, contact). No permanent intrusive sidebars; main nav is a top floating menu that can expand (hidden hamburger for small screens). Provide keyboard navigation and deep-linking (URL hash / route per section).
- Interaction examples: Cards you can "get inside" (open into a 3D scene), continuous particle trails around cards, live glass reflections, snow/frost effects, audio ambience toggle, ambient background audio with volume controls, and a toggle for reduced-motion / low-bandwidth mode.

Tech stack & libraries (mandatory recommendations):
- Framework: React + Next.js (app router) for SSR/ISR, SEO, and routing.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling; design tokens in a single config.
- 3D: Three.js (React-three-fiber / @react-three/fiber) + drei helpers; use glTF/GLB models; include an optional Babylon.js fallback for complex scenes if necessary.
- Animations: Framer Motion for UI animations; use post-processing / shader passes for glow, bloom, and glass.
- Shaders: Custom GLSL fragment/vertex shaders for electric pulses, glass distortion, and snow effects (use react-three-fiber shaderMaterial patterns).
- Sounds: WebAudio API + Howler.js (or tiny wrapper) for ambient and UI sounds; implement mute and volume UI.
- Performance: use react-use-lazy, dynamic imports (next/dynamic), LOD for 3D assets, draco-compressed glTF, and a "reduced motion / low-power" toggle to disable heavy effects.
- Accessibility: Lighthouse friendly (a11y), ARIA labels, keyboard navigable menus, focus states.
- Testing: Basic end-to-end tests with Playwright (navigation flows), unit tests with Vitest + React Testing Library.
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions for build, test, and deploy. Provide a workflow that builds and deploys to Vercel (or GitHub Pages if the user prefers).
- Dev tools: Storybook for major UI components; local dev script with mocked 3D assets loading.
- TypeScript everywhere. ESLint + Prettier config + husky git hooks for lint-staged.

Core features to implement (deliverables):
1. **Hero landing animation**  
   - Full-screen 3D canvas hero (react-three-fiber) that animates in on first load:
     * A central semi-transparent "crystal box" or "glass orb" containing a subtle 3D avatar/placeholder, particle flows, and a persona visualization as a floating card.
     * Intro animation with text reveal: name (Danish Anwar), tagline (e.g., "Visionary Creator — Tech & Art"), with a sparkly "sprinkle" tail that follows the cursor (reduced on mobile).
     * Auto-play ambient audio (muted by default, user-toggle visible).

2. **About / Persona section**  
   - Create an interactive visualization of Danish's persona as a large card with downloadable option. Provide a dynamic summary based on his characteristics: visionary, tech innovator, creative, ethical, ambitious.
   - Animations must be subtle (card tilt on cursor, glass sheen).

3. **Projects / Case studies**  
   - Each project is a swipeable 3D card stack (horizontal carousel on wide screens + swipe on mobile). Each card should:
     * Show a short summary, tech stack badges, animated 3D thumbnail (small glTF scene or live shader preview), and clickable "Enter" button that expands the card into a full-screen interactive 3D showcase.
     * Include live code link (GitHub Repo), demo (if available), and detailed writeup (problem, approach, architecture, results).
   - Provide placeholders for at least 4 sample projects: (IronMan-suit-prototype, GameEngine-R&D, Analog-Computing-Article, Personal-Tools).

4. **3D Explorations gallery**  
   - A separate immersive area where users can "walk into" 3D boxes or portals that reveal micro-experiences:
     * "Glass Box" with snow + frost shader
     * "Electric Chamber" with continuous electric pulses & interactive switches
     * "Fairy-Tale Forest" minimal scene with parallax particle snow falling and soft lighting
   - Use orbit controls plus keyboard WASD for optional exploration mode (toggleable).

5. **Skills & Timeline**  
   - Animated timeline with collapsible 3D nodes. Each node shows years, roles, and micro case examples. Use accessible markup for screen readers.

6. **Contact / CTA**  
   - Contact form (Netlify/Vercel serverless function or a suggested API) with spam protection (honey pot + rate limit).
   - Downloadable resume (PDF), link to GitHub, LinkedIn, email, and a gentle CTA to "Collaborate on something visionary."

7. **Settings drawer**  
   - Toggle themes (Dark / Light), reduce motion, audio toggle, quality (High / Medium / Low). Persist settings in localStorage.

8. **Admin / Content system (light)**  
   - Projects should be stored as Markdown / MDX files in repo `/content/projects/` so the user can edit project data and images. Provide a simple script to regenerate static props.

Code & repository expectations:
- Clear folder structure:
```
/src
/components
/layouts
/pages (or app/ if using Next.js app router)
/three (3d scenes, shaders, loaders)
/styles
/content
/public/assets
/lib (audio, analytics, utils)
/tests
```
- Comprehensive README.md: project overview, local setup, scripts, environment variables, deploy steps (Vercel), contribution guide, and how to add new projects or 3D scenes.
- Add `design-tokens.json` for colors, spaces, fonts and provide Tailwind config to use tokens.
- Provide a `manifest.json` and PWA support (installable).
- Create Storybook stories for: Hero Canvas, ProjectCard, 3DSceneWrapper, Settings Drawer, Contact Form.
- Create unit tests for core UI behaviors and one Playwright e2e test verifying main navigation and hero animation loads.

Performance & production readiness:
- Use code-splitting and lazy loading for heavy scenes. Provide a server/edge-rendered fallback for no-JS users (progressive enhancement).
- Use image optimization (next/image) and compressed glTF assets; include draco support and compressed textures.
- Lighthouse score target: 90+ on Performance/Accessibility/Best Practices.
- Provide a `DEPLOY.md` explaining how to connect to Vercel and set environment variables.

Developer ergonomics & automation:
- Add Husky + lint-staged, GitHub Actions:
- `ci.yml` runs TypeScript check, lint, tests, and Storybook build; on success it deploys to preview environment.
- `deploy-prod.yml` deploys to Vercel on merge to main.
- Provide CONTRIBUTING.md, ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md, PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md.

UX copy & microcopy:
- Provide concise, human-first copy for headings, CTAs, and UX hints. Use a visionary, gentle, confident tone. Example hero tagline: "I build tech that feels like a fairy tale — efficient, thoughtful, unforgettable."

Assets & placeholders:
- Include example glTF/GLB assets (small, included in `/public/assets/3d/`) generated procedurally or from safe placeholders. Provide a script to replace placeholders with final models.

Deliver commit plan & PR structure:
- Break the work into incremental commits with clear messages:
1. `feat: init nextjs + typescript + tailwind + eslint + prettier`
2. `feat: add hero 3d canvas scaffold (r3f) + persona image asset`
3. `feat: implement project card + mdx content`
4. `feat: add settings drawer + accessibility toggles`
5. `test: add unit tests & e2e playwright`
6. `ci: add GitHub Actions + deploy config`
7. `docs: README + DEPLOY.md + CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Create a first PR `feat/3d-portfolio-v1 -> main` with description of scope and a preview link.

Important acceptance criteria (what to hand over):
- A working preview/deploy URL (Vercel recommended).
- Full repository changes pushed to the branch with above commits.
- README with setup & deployment instructions.
- Storybook hosted or build artifact included.
- Playwright e2e test passing in CI.
- Accessibility checks: ARIA attributes & keyboard focus navigation must work.
- A simple video/gif (30s) in `/public/docs/preview.mp4` demonstrating main flows (hero, open project, 3D exploration).

Tone & product design notes for implementation:
- Make it cinematic but not gimmicky — polished motion, thoughtful pacing, and clear affordances.
- Prioritize clarity: interactions must be discoverable and intuitive.
- Provide fallback static UI for low-power devices.

Finally, after building:
- Create a simple `Demo Instructions` section in README that tells Danish (the owner) how to update projects, replace 3D models, and tweak theme Tokens.
- Create one small script `tools/generate-assets.md` explaining how to add optimized GLB images and the necessary compress steps (draco, basis).

Use the repository to push code and open the PR. Make sure each change is atomic and well-documented. If anything cannot be completed (e.g., heavy custom shaders requiring artist assets), provide a high-quality placeholder with instructions and hooks so Danish can add the final art later.

Build this with the ambition, craft, and polish that matches Danish Anwar's vision — a technical portfolio that *feels* like stepping into a beautiful, futuristic fairy-tale world while clearly demonstrating mastery and projects.
